In the case of an invalidly described die, explain why the probabilities are invalid.\n\nSolution: Explain the probability of each of the dice.\n\nProblem: The dice are not fair. In order to describe an unfair die properly, we must specify the probability for each of the six possible outcomes. The following table gives answers for each of 4 different dice.\n\n| Probabilities | Outcome | Die 1 | Die 2 | Die 3 | Die 4 |\n\n|---------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n\n|              | 1       | 1/3   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/3   |\n\n|               | 2      | 1/7   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/3   |\n\n|               | 3      | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6   | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  | 1/6  |",

Provide a clear, step-by-step solution, including all necessary calculations:\n\nProblem: Water samples are taken from water used for cooling as it is being discharged from a power plant into a river. It has been determined that as long as the mean temperature of the discharged water is at most 150\u00b0F, there will be no negative effects on the river\u2019s ecosystem. To investigate compliance with regulations prohibiting a mean temperature above 150\u00b0F, 50 water samples will be taken at randomly selected times and the temperature of each sample recorded. The resulting data will be used to test the hypotheses H0: \u03bc = 150 versus Ha: \u03bc > 150. In this context, describe Type I and Type II errors.

The article \"A Field Trial of Ketamine Anesthesia in the Horse\" (Equine Vet. J., 1984: 176-179) reports that for a sample of n = 73 horses to which ketamine was administered under certain conditions, the sample average lateral recumbency (lying-down) time was 18.86 min and the standard deviation was 8.6 min.

The paper \"Automatic Segmentation of Medical Images Using Image Registration: Diagnostic and Simulation Applications\" (J. of Medical Engr. and Tech., 2005: 53-63) discussed a new technique for such identification. A measure of the accuracy of the automatic region is the average linear displacement (ALD).

Does the data in fact provide strong evidence for concluding that true average ALD under these circumstances is less than 1.0? Carry out an appropriate test of hypotheses.\n\n d.
