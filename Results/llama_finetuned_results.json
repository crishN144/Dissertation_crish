Five of the students reported their starting salaries: $55,000, $90,250, $90,250, $95,500, and $105,000. What is the largest possible value of the median starting salary for all seven students?\n\nSolution: Step 1: Arrange the reported salaries in ascending order: [55,000, 90,250, 90,250, 95,500, 105,000]. Step 2: Insert a placeholder value (denoted by 'x') to represent the missing data point. Arrange the full dataset in ascending order: [55,000, 90,250, x, 90,250, 95,500, 105,000]. Step 3: The median is the middle value of the dataset. If the number of data points is odd, the median is the value at the middle position. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle values. Step 4: For the given dataset, there are 7 data points. If the missing value is less than 90,250, then the median will be 90,250. If the missing value is greater than or equal to 90,250, then the median will be 95,500.

Explain why it might be preferable to use this Ha rather than \u03bc < 100.\n\nSolution: Testing H0: \u03bc = 100 versus Ha: \u03bc > 100 allows us to determine if the welds are stronger than the specified strength of 100 lb/in2. If the team wants to ensure that the welds meet the requirements, it is important to check if the mean strength exceeds the required level. Testing H0: \u03bc = 100 versus Ha: \u03bc < 100 would indicate if the welds are weaker than 100 lb/in2, but this may not be as relevant for ensuring safety and compliance with regulations.\n\nConclusion: Testing H0: \u03bc = 100 versus Ha: \u03bc > 100 is appropriate because it assesses whether the welds meet the required strength level.\n\nExplanation: Testing Ha: \u03bc > 100 helps in identifying if the welds are stronger than the specified threshold, which is crucial for ensuring safety and compliance.

The professor believes that the higher mean in Class B is due to greater variability in grades. Is this a reasonable interpretation?\n\nSolution: 1. To determine if the higher mean in Class B is due to greater variability, compare the coefficient of variation (CV) for both classes.\n2. Calculate the CV for Class A: \\( \\frac{5}{75} \\times 100 \\approx 6.67\\% \\).\n3. Calculate the CV for Class B: \\( \\frac{8}{80} \\times 100 \\approx 10\\% \\).\n4.
